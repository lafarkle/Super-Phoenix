# Super Phoenix PCB
## Welcome
This is my contribution to the Super Phoenix PCB.

This is based around the ESP32-C3 processor from Esperiff.  It is a successor to the popular ESP8266 Espperiff.  Specifically this uses the ESP32-C3-DEVKITM-1.

You can see what you need to get started here:  [GETTING_STARTED](https://github.com/lafarkle/Super-Phoenix/blob/main/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)

You can see the Hardware Reference Manual here: [ESP32-C3-DevKitM-1](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/hw-reference/esp32c3/user-guide-devkitm-1.html)
